5. User can choose to continue staking or withdraw CELO

## 5. Real User Flow Simulation

### 5.1 User Staking CELO
- User connects wallet to platform
- User stakes 0.01 CELO to StakingPool contract
- System records user's staked amount
- User's staking status activated, allowing participation in eco verifications

### 5.2 User Eco Verification
- User uses reusable cup and uploads photo to platform
- Platform verifiers (AI system + manual review) confirm photo validity
- Verifier calls VerificationRegistry contract to record verification
- User completes required 3 daily verifications (e.g., morning, noon, evening)

### 5.3 User Reward Eligibility
- System checks if user completed 3 verifications today
- System confirms user hasn't claimed today's rewards
- System confirms user's eligibility for rewards

### 5.4 System Reward Calculation
- Rewards calculated based on user's stake amount and daily APR (5%)
- Example: 0.01 CELO stake, 5% daily rate = 0.0005 CELO equivalent in tokens daily

### 5.5 User Reward Claim
- User clicks "Claim Reward" button
- RewardController contract calculates and distributes rewards
- System mints corresponding amount of EcoCupToken to user's wallet
- VerificationRegistry marks today's rewards as claimed to prevent double-claiming

### 5.6 User Reward View
- User can check accumulated EcoCupToken balance in wallet
- Tokens may have additional utilities like physical item redemption or ecosystem benefits

### 5.7 User Withdrawal (Optional)
- User can withdraw partial or full staked CELO if desired
- After withdrawal, user's reward potential decreases accordingly

### 5.8 Multi-user Scenarios
Different users staking different CELO amounts receive proportional rewards:
- User A stakes 0.01 CELO, earns ~0.0005 CELO equivalent in tokens daily after verification
- User B stakes 0.02 CELO, earns ~0.001 CELO equivalent in tokens daily after verification
